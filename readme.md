READ THIS DOCUMENTATION FROM ORIGINAL FIRST.

Next, here are the additionls made to improve editing this project:
Inside "host" folder, "REBUILD_NPM_BATCH.bat." Originally it was required to do "NPM run build" after cding into the correct directory, but now you can double click this function and execute this command instantly. YOU NEED TO DO THIS WHEN INSTALLING FOR THE FIRST TIME/DURING EDIT CHANGES (as described in original documentation).

After installing to folder C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro 2025\CEP\extensions\Your_Extension, there is another benefit of this starter project fork: Inside the premiere window for PremiereRemote, there is a button that is labeled "Open AHK Script", which opens the file explorer directory of the extension itself, allowing you to quickly activate the AHK Script when opening Premiere.

Additionally, this package comes with a few pre-built keybinds in the included AHK script:
1. Automatically changing selected tracks to muted/unmuted (by looking at level of first selected track, is it over/under 0dB, and subsequently forcing all tracks to be -inf or 0dB)
2. Better ripple delete (puts playhead at the end of the track instead of the beginning)

Finally, this starter project is slightly better than original because it shows you how PremierePro can respond to your inputs (which is described *as possible* by original documentation but not well explained/documented).
ONLY EDIT THE "host" folder. That is the only folder you should be editing when working on your own hotkeys/js functions. Inside host/src/index.tsx is the js functions that are linked to the AHK script. Remember, when editing, run the bat file to auto-run 'npm run build.'
Happy scripting!
